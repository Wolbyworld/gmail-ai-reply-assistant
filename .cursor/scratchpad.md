# Gmail AI Reply Assistant - Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

This is a Chrome extension called "Gmail AI Reply Assistant" that helps users draft email replies using OpenAI's GPT models. The extension integrates directly into Gmail's compose interface, providing AI-powered text generation and improvement features.

New request (User): Update the extension to default to `gpt-5` with reasoning effort set to minimal, expose `gpt-5` on the config page, and add an options UI control to select reasoning effort levels. Ensure the manifest version is bumped for this change.

### Current State Analysis

**Current Version:** 0.6.0 (in src/manifest.json)
**Extension Type:** Manifest V3 Chrome Extension
**Primary Features:**
- AI-powered email reply generation with keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+H)
- Text improvement feature with keyboard shortcut (Cmd+Shift+G) 
- Modal interface for inputting talking points
- Options page for API key and model configuration
- Works across all URLs with Gmail-specific optimizations

### Project Structure
```
src/
├── background.js          # Service worker - handles OpenAI API calls, settings
├── content.js            # Content script - Gmail DOM manipulation, UI injection
├── manifest.json         # Extension manifest (current: v0.6.0)
├── options/             # Settings page (API key, model, prompts)
├── ui/                  # Modal interface files
├── utils/               # Shared utilities (gmail.js, storage.js)
└── icons/               # Extension icons
```

### Build Process
- **Build Script:** `build.sh` creates `dist/` folder
- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (defined in package.json)
- **Distribution:** Creates `gmail-ai-reply-assistant.zip` file
- **Build excludes test directories automatically**

### Key Technical Details
- **Architecture:** Background script + Content script pattern
- **Storage:** Chrome sync storage for settings
- **API Integration:** OpenAI Chat Completions API

Note: For `gpt-5` and reasoning effort, we will migrate to the recommended API (likely Responses API) if needed, ensuring no breaking changes. We will verify exact parameter shape for reasoning effort and keep behavior consistent.
- **UI Framework:** Vanilla JS with Shadow DOM for modal
- **Testing:** Jest test suite with comprehensive coverage
- **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier with Git hooks

### Current Git Status
- Modified files: `dist/manifest.json`, `src/manifest.json`, `gmail-ai-reply-assistant.zip`
- Branch: main (up to date with origin/main)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Version Management:** Need to increment manifest version with each update
2. **Build Process:** Understand dist creation and deployment workflow  
3. **Dual Manifest Management:** Both src/ and dist/ have manifest.json that need version sync
4. **Feature Updates:** Need to understand what two updates are planned

5. Confirm latest OpenAI API contract for `gpt-5` and reasoning effort: exact parameter name, allowed values (use whatever the API supports), and whether Chat Completions endpoint supports it or if migration to Responses API is required. Proceed with migration while avoiding breaking changes.
6. Ensure settings consistency: `src/options/options.js` manages `composeModel`, `gmailImproveModel`, and `generalImproveModel`, while `src/utils/storage.js` defaults do not include those keys; align defaults and tests.
7. Backwards compatibility: Introduce per-feature reasoning effort settings (`composeReasoningEffort`, `improveReasoningEffort`) and handle missing values by applying defaults without breaking users.
8. Manifest version bump: Update both `src/manifest.json` and generated `dist/manifest.json` via the build workflow.

## High-level Task Breakdown

- [x] **Task 1.2:** Document version increment process  
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Clear process for updating manifest version
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Ensure both src/ and dist/ manifests stay in sync

### Phase 2: Update Implementation 
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Update System Prompts ✅
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Replace Gmail Composer prompt with new version
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Gmail Text Improver prompt confirmed (no changes needed)
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Update General Typo Catcher prompt with new version
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Manifest version incremented to 0.6.1
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Core tests pass (storage tests updated and passing)
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Remove GPT-4.5-Preview Model Option ✅
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Remove gpt-4.5-preview from all model selectors
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Set gpt-4.1 as default everywhere
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Manifest version incremented to 0.6.2
  - ✅ Success Criteria: Core tests pass (no new test failures introduced)

### Phase 3: Build and Deployment
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Build updated extension
  - Success Criteria: Clean dist/ build with updated versions
  - Success Criteria: Generated zip file is valid
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Verify extension functionality
  - Success Criteria: Manual testing in Chrome shows all features work
  - Success Criteria: No console errors or warnings

### Phase 4: GPT-5 + Reasoning Effort (New)

- [ ] **Task 4.1: Documentation Verification Spike**
  - Define: Verify the correct API endpoint and parameter for reasoning effort with `gpt-5` (e.g., `reasoning_effort` vs. `reasoning: { effort }`, Chat Completions vs Responses API).
  - Success Criteria: A short note with the exact parameter name, allowed values, and endpoint to use, with one authoritative source link captured in this scratchpad.

- [ ] **Task 4.2: Storage Schema Update**
  - Define: Add per-feature reasoning effort settings: `composeReasoningEffort` and `improveReasoningEffort` (default both to `"minimal"`). Ensure defaults include `composeModel`, `gmailImproveModel`, and `generalImproveModel` all defaulting to `"gpt-5"` (per user decision).
  - Success Criteria: `getSettings()` returns defaults including both effort settings and all model defaults; legacy users load with defaults.
  - TDD: Extend `src/utils/__tests__/storage.test.js` to cover the new default and merging behavior.

- [ ] **Task 4.3: Options UI Update**
  - Define: In `src/options/options.html` and `src/options/options.js`, add `gpt-5` to all three model selectors and introduce two new dropdowns: `Compose Reasoning Effort` and `Improve Reasoning Effort`. Populate values with whatever the API supports (anticipated: `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`), default both to `minimal`. Wire load/save through storage and restore defaults.
  - Success Criteria: Options page shows `gpt-5` and two effort controls; values persist and restore works.

- [ ] **Task 4.4: Background API Integration**
  - Define: Update `callOpenAI` (or introduce a new call) in `src/background.js` to pass the per-feature reasoning effort parameter using the verified API contract. If migration to Responses API is required, implement it carefully to avoid breaking changes. Use `composeReasoningEffort` for generate flow; `improveReasoningEffort` for improve flow (both Gmail and generic).
  - Success Criteria: API calls include effort from settings; errors surface to UI; both flows use their respective effort settings.

- [ ] **Task 4.5: Tests and Snapshots**
  - Define: Update or add tests for storage defaults and any changed logic; update manifest snapshot tests if present; ensure CI tests pass locally.
  - Success Criteria: `npm test` green; snapshots updated where appropriate.

- [ ] **Task 4.6: Manifest Version Bump**
  - Define: Bump `src/manifest.json` version to `0.7.0` and ensure the dist manifest reflects the same after build.
  - Success Criteria: Version visible as `0.7.0` in both `src/` and built `dist/` and any related snapshot tests are updated.

- [ ] **Task 4.7: Build and Manual Verification**
  - Define: Build (`./build.sh`), load unpacked extension, verify: model defaults to `gpt-5`, reasoning effort default `minimal`, options save/restore works, generation and improve flows succeed without errors.
  - Success Criteria: Manual checks pass on Gmail; console shows API payload includes reasoning effort as expected.

Remaining optional clarifications:
- Do you want to retain `gpt-4.1` as a selectable fallback option in the model dropdowns alongside `gpt-5`?
- Any copy/help text preferred on the Options page to explain effort trade-offs (speed vs depth), or keep UI minimal?

### Build Process Verified ✅:
- `npm run build` creates dist/ folder but NOT the zip file
- `./build.sh` does complete build including creating `gmail-ai-reply-assistant.zip`
- All files correctly copied to dist/, test directories excluded as expected

## Lessons

### Project-Specific Notes:
- Extension uses Manifest V3 with service worker pattern
- Build process automatically excludes test directories
- Both src/ and dist/ contain manifest.json - need to keep versions in sync
- Extension has comprehensive Jest test suite that should be run after changes
- OpenAI API key stored in Chrome sync storage for security
- Content script injects UI into Gmail's compose interface using DOM manipulation

### Development Best Practices:
- Always run tests after making changes (`npm test`)
- Use `./build.sh` script to create complete distribution version (dist/ + zip)
- `npm run build` only creates dist/ folder, does NOT create zip file
- Increment manifest version for every user-facing change
- Test in actual Gmail interface after building
- Both npm run build and ./build.sh exclude test directories automatically
- When updating default prompts, remember to update test expectations in storage.test.js
- Use `npm test -- -u` to update snapshots when manifest changes

### Update 1 - System Prompts (v0.6.1) ✅:
- **Gmail Composer:** Updated to include paragraph guidance, <> instruction notation, and Álvaro signature
- **Gmail Text Improver:** No changes needed (user provided same prompt)  
- **General Typo Catcher:** Enhanced with simplification guidance, period rules, and <> instruction notation
- **Files Modified:** src/options/options.js, src/utils/storage.js, src/manifest.json, src/utils/__tests__/storage.test.js
- **Testing:** Updated storage tests to match new default prompts, manifest snapshot updated
- **Build:** Successfully created v0.6.1 extension package

### Update 2 - Model Selectors (v0.6.2) ✅:
- **Removed:** gpt-4.5-preview option from all three model selectors (Gmail Composer, Gmail Text Improver, General Typo Catcher)  
- **Default Updated:** Changed DEFAULT_COMPOSE_MODEL from gpt-4.5-preview to gpt-4.1
- **Consistency:** All models now default to gpt-4.1 for consistency
- **Files Modified:** src/options/options.html, src/options/options.js, src/manifest.json
- **Testing:** No new test failures introduced, core functionality preserved
- **Build:** Successfully created v0.6.2 extension package

### Update 3 - Fix Keyboard Shortcut (v0.6.3) ✅:
- **Issue Fixed:** Command+Shift+H shortcut only worked when user was already focused in compose window
- **Root Cause:** triggerGenerateReply() only checked document.activeElement instead of using fallback logic
- **Solution:** Modified triggerGenerateReply() to use existing findActiveComposeWindow() function
- **Improvement:** Now automatically finds any available compose window on Gmail page, even if not focused
- **User Experience:** Shortcut now works from anywhere on Gmail (inbox, reading emails, etc.)
- **Files Modified:** src/content.js, src/manifest.json
- **Technical Details:** Added composeWindow.focus() call so user sees which window was selected
- **Build:** Successfully created v0.6.3 extension package
